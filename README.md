# TrafficSign-classification-and-Flow prediction


This project presents a comprehensive deep learning-based system that integrates both traffic sign classification and traffic flow prediction — essential components for the development of autonomous driving and smart traffic management systems.


## Key Features
-**Traffic Sign Classification**: Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (LeNet architecture) to recognize and classify various types of traffic signs from images.

-**Traffic Flow Prediction**: Employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor to forecast the number of vehicles in a given time frame, enabling proactive traffic control.

-**Integrated System**: Offers a unified solution combining vision and prediction tasks for intelligent transportation applications.


## Technologies Used
**Programming Language**: Python

**Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn

**Deep Learning Models**:

LeNet CNN for traffic sign image classification

MLP Regressor for vehicle count prediction


## Results
**Traffic Sign Classification Accuracy**: Achieved up to 85% accuracy using LeNet CNN on benchmark datasets.

**Traffic Flow Prediction**: MLP Regressor effectively predicted vehicle flow trends with low MSE and high R² score.
